Define success to you.

To me, success encompasses achieving personal fulfillment and making a positive impact on others and the world around me. It's about setting and striving towards meaningful goals, continuously learning and growing, maintaining strong relationships, and contributing to the well-being of society. Success is not just about financial wealth or status, but also about finding balance, happiness, and fulfillment in all aspects of life.
